    <p class= "Week 1 paragraph">
      Technically, the week of September 9th is not the first week of school but I will call it that because it is the first week of learning so I will refer to it as the first week. Anyway,this week is the week where we presented our presentations about the speedcubing documentary "Why we Cube." This was also the week where I created this website and Learned how to use Adobe Premiere. Because I have already completed most of the assignments that the teacher has assigned for me I am currently ahead of the game leaving this website the only assignment that I have yet to complete. This week has been pretty uneventful but I hope that the weeks to come will be better.
