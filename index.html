      Giant tropical centipedes share their territories with tarantulas.<br>
      Despite it's impressive length, it's a nimble navigator,
      And some can be highly venomous.<br>
      As quick as lightning, just like the tarantula it's killing,
      The centipede has two curved hollow fangs which inject paralyzing venom.<br>
      Even tarantulas aren't immune from an ambush.
